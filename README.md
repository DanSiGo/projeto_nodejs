projeto site pastelaria com crud de card√°pio

This project was made during a crash course of NodeJS. 

The tecnologies involved are: materialize, expressjs, mysql

In this course was taught how to create a simple page of an restaurant, creating the following pages:
home page: with brief description
the menu page: with itens stored in a mysql database we created using xampp and workbench
the create page: using the html verbs to pass parameters for the backend to store in the data base
the update page: same to create, but passing the current data for the page that updates

The delete button is showed in the menu page and works deleting the item by the title of the item, that is passed within the url
